# Matthew Dubea – Mechanical Engineering Portfolio

Hi, I’m Matthew — a mechanical engineering senior graduating in May 2025 from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. I specialize in hands-on mechanical systems, CAD design, and performance-based engineering with real-world application. My focus is design-for-manufacturability, structural performance, and creative mechanical solutions backed by physical testing.

## 🏁 Senior Design – Human-Powered Tricycle (Acadiana 500)

**Team:** Fast Pedal Engineers  
**Result:** 🥇 1st Place Overall  
**Top Speed:** ~14.5 mph  
**Final Time:** 3 minutes 31 seconds  
**Track:** 0.66-mile relay w/ 8-person rotation

We engineered and fabricated a racing trike from scratch to comply with all Acadiana 500 rules: no chains, no gears, and direct pedal-to-wheel front-drive. Our final design was a TIG-welded steel frame with custom rear axle bushings, seat anchors, and tight race tolerances. The trike had a low center of gravity, even weight distribution, and high lateral stability.

### 🔧 My Contributions:
- Designed full CAD assembly in SolidWorks (frame, stem extension, axle, fork)
- Performed FEA on axle and frame to determine max stress (σ_vm ≈ 2.8e8 N/m²)
- Created engineering documentation: spec sheets, tolerance drawings, budget analysis
- Managed machining and fabrication (CNC bushing sleeves, brass spacers)
- Modeled tipping angle, stress, CG location, and lap-time analysis
