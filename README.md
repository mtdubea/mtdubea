# Matthew Dubea â€“ Mechanical Engineering Portfolio

Hi, Iâ€™m Matthew â€” a mechanical engineering senior graduating in May 2025 from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Iâ€™ve spent the last few years building a foundation in product design, mechanical systems, and manufacturingâ€”with a particular focus on turning rough concepts into real, working machines.

Most of my work blends CAD modeling, hands-on fabrication, and performance testing. I'm especially interested in designing for manufacturability and integrating mechanical systems with real-world constraints.

## ðŸŽ¯ Featured Project â€“ Human-Powered Racing Tricycle (Acadiana 500)

**Team:** Fast Pedal Engineers  
**Result:** ðŸ¥‡ 1st Place out of all competitors  
**Race Format:** 0.66-mile team relay, 8 riders  
**Top Speed:** ~14.5 mph  
**Final Time:** 3 minutes, 31 seconds  

This project pushed my skills in CAD, FEA, machining, and race-day problem solving. We designed and built a custom tricycle from a modified bicycle frame, with a direct-drive front wheel and a CNC-machined rear axle housing.

### My Contributions:
- SolidWorks: Designed full frame, drivetrain, and custom stem extension
- FEA: Verified axle bending stress, von Mises analysis (max stress â‰ˆ 2.8e8 N/mÂ²)
- TIG welding: Collaborated with machinists to TIG-weld critical joints
- CG modeling: Calculated weight distribution and tipping thresholds
- Technical documentation: Created spec sheets, BOMs, and test reports
